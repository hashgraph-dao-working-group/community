# Hashgraph DAO Working Group
(STATUS: WORK IN PROGRESS) 

## What we do

The Hedera DAO Working Group is a professional group composed of projects and companies in the community that are invested in the development of DAO’s (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations).

The working group was formed by a group of passionate people who are all building or developing DAO related projects, and recognize the benefit of having a forum for sharing information. We had our first meeting on July 19th, 2022 and meet twice a month to discuss all things related to DAOs.

While many of the members are or intend to run DAO’s, the goal of the working group is not related to operations or active management of DAOs, but on developing and making available the infrastructural underpinnings to enable others in the community to launch their own DAOs.

## Our Mission

Is to help the DAO ecosystem on Hedera thrive through the generation of infrastructure, tooling, standards and educational material, and provide a productive forum for community collaboration.
